2025-11-24 — Initial Project Setup

Added project Makefile with compilation rules for mandatory part.

Integrated libft into the project (submodule / folder build supported).

Integrated MiniLibX (mlx) and fixed Linux configuration permissions.

Successfully implemented the first MLX window, including:

mlx initialization

window creation

ESC key handling

window close (red cross) handling

Verified that the core graphical environment now runs correctly.

This marks the completion of the project bootstrap phase: build system ready, core libraries integrated, and window loop functional.
